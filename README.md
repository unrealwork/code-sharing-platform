# Project: Code Sharing Platform

### About
There is a lot of collaboration in programming: many projects require sharing your code with other developers. Using open web resources such as Pastebin is not always an option. In this project, you will create your own secure version of a code-sharing platform.

### Learning outcomes
You will get acquainted with server development on Spring Boot and touch on some basic topics in Web-programming such as:
 * HTML 
 * CSS 
 * JS
